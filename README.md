## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- ### Virtual Scientific Event

- **User Registration**: Attendees can register for the event.
- **Speaker and Topic List**: View a comprehensive list of speakers and the topics they will discuss.
- **Event Schedule**: Access the event schedule to plan your attendance.

- ### Startup Technology Conference

- **Ticket Purchase**: Users can register and purchase tickets for the conference.
- **Startup Profiles**: View detailed profiles of participating startups, including their products and innovations.
- **Voting System**: Attendees can vote for their favorite startups to encourage innovation.
- **Networking Section**: Connect with other attendees through a dedicated networking area.

## My process

### Built with

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup**: Ensuring clarity and accessibility.
- **Custom CSS Properties**: For improved styling flexibility.
- **Grid and Flexbox**: Utilized for effective layout structure.
- **Mobile-First Workflow**: Ensuring responsiveness across devices.

### What I learned

This project allowed me to practice HTML and CSS design and layout concepts, specifically:

- Using **Flexbox and Grid** to create responsive layouts.
- Creating **interactive buttons** (register, vote) for an intuitive user experience.
- Building a visually appealing and functional structure tailored to specific event needs.

```html
<header>
  <h1>Startup Technology Conference</h1>
  <button class="register-btn">Buy Ticket</button>
</header>
```

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects, it would be ideal to integrate backend systems and databases to manage registered users and votes in real time. Additionally, incorporating a CMS would allow organizers to modify content without code intervention.

### Useful resources

- **CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Grid**: This guide helped me understand CSS Grid structure.
- **MDN Web Docs**: Comprehensive documentation on HTML, CSS, and best web development practices.
